## Post-Installation
After installation, remember to place a config file ([example](https://github.com/aesophor/wmderland/blob/master/example/config)) at **~/.config/wmderland/config**.

Please EDIT it first! Or you'll get a blackscreen. [How to edit config?](https://github.com/aesophor/wmderland/blob/master/BUILD.md#configure-and-run)
